## JS Built In Functions

* `prompt();` -> shows a dialog which prompts the user to enter something. 
* `parseInt();`
* `isNaN()` -> checks if the value is NaN.

### Conditional Expressions / Ternary Operator

> If statements do NOT return a value! For this case where you need to conditionally return a value you use a ternary operator. 

`const varName = condition ? 'trueResult' : 'falseResult';`

You can nest ternary operators however, that could prevent code readability.
